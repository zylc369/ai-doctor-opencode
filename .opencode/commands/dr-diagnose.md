# Dr. Ralph Diagnose Command

Start the full diagnostic workflow using OpenCode's ralph-loop mechanism.

**Note:** This command defines the diagnostic workflow directly. No external setup script is needed (removed from Claude Code migration).

## Parameter Description
1. `$1`: The symptom to be diagnosed. This parameter is required. If not provided, the command execution will be terminated.
2. `$2`: The patient's name. This parameter is optional.

## PHASE-BASED WORKFLOW

**Note:** All output—including questions, analysis, and SOAP reports—uses the language of the reported symptom(for example, If the symptom is described in Chinese, all output must be in Chinese).

This command runs through 6 phases:

1. **Patient's Name** - Obtain the patient's name for both the running notes and the patient notes
2. **Interview** - Use question tool for comprehensive medical intake
3. **Research** - websearch_web_search_exa for literature, guidelines, treatment protocols
4. **Differential** - Analyze findings to determine diagnosis
5. **Treatment** - Develop research-backed action plan
6. **Report** - Generate SOAP format documentation

## CRITICAL RULES

### 0. OBTAIN PATIENT'S NAME FIRST
1. **If a patient name is provided via `$1`, use it.**
2. Otherwise, attempt to retrieve the patient name from the current session:
    - If a name is retrieved, use the question tool to verify its correctness and also allow the user to input a patient name.
    - If no name is retrieved from the session, require users to input the patient's name.

**Always prioritize the patient name entered by the user.**

### 1. MEDICAL RECORDS SECOND
Before symptom questions, ask if patient has medical records to share. Process files ONE BY ONE:
- Check file size with `ls -la` or `stat` before reading
- If file > 3MB: Alert user, offer to skip or provide smaller version
- Suggest Adobe Acrobat to split large PDFs
- Never let one bad file crash the workflow

### 2. USE question TOOL FOR ALL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
You MUST use the question tool for every interview question. Do NOT output questions as plain text.

### 3. MAINTAIN RUNNING NOTES
Write findings to the patient notes file after each phase. Use timestamps for all entries.

### 4. READ EXISTING PATIENT HISTORY
If patient notes exist, READ them first to understand previous sessions before beginning.

**patient notes file name format**: `[patient name]-PatientNote-[timestamp].md`.

### 5. USE websearch_web_search_exa FOR RESEARCH
Search for medical literature, guidelines, and treatment protocols. Use inline citations.

### 6. FOLLOW PHASE ORDER
Complete each phase fully before moving to the next. Announce phase transitions.

### 7. MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
This is an AI-assisted tool. Always remind patients this is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Remind them to redact sensitive information.

### 8. FLAG RED FLAGS
If emergency symptoms are detected (chest pain + SOB, sudden severe headache, etc.), flag them prominently but continue the workflow.

## OUTPUT FILES

- **Running Notes:** `@notes/[patient name]-PatientNote-[timestamp].md` - Updated throughout session
- **Final Report:** `@notes/[patient name]-report-[timestamp].md` - SOAP format

**timestamp format**: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_SSS`. **YYYYMMDD**: year, month, day. **HHMMSS**: hour, minute, second. **SSS**: millisecond.

## COMPLETION

**CRITICAL:** After completing all phases and writing the SOAP report, you MUST signal completion:

- Output: `<promise>DONE</promise>`

This signals the ralph-loop hook to stop iteration. The loop will not stop until this promise is detected.

**If user provided `--completion-promise TEXT` flag:**
- Output: `<promise>TEXT</promise>` (replace TEXT with the user's promise phrase)
